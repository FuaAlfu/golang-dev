# maximum subarray  in golang
The Maximum Subarray problem involves finding a contiguous subarray within an array of numbers that has the largest sum. Here's an explanation and an example code in Go to solve the Maximum Subarray problem using the Kadane's algorithm:

1. "Initialize" two variables: `maxSoFar` and `maxEndingHere` to track the maximum sum seen so far and the maximum sum ending at the current element respectively.

2. "Iterate" through the array:
   - For each element, update `maxEndingHere` by taking the maximum of the current element or the sum of the current element and the previous `maxEndingHere`.
   - Update `maxSoFar` by taking the maximum of the current `maxSoFar` and `maxEndingHere`.

3. "Return" `maxSoFar` as the maximum sum of any subarray in the given array.
