# new()
 is a built-in function that is used to allocate memory. The first argument is a type, not a value, and the value returned is a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of that type.

 ## keep note
 It accepts one parameter *TYPE* and returns the pointer of the Type.
 so The return type of the new() function is *Type, it returns the pointer of the Type.
