## about aws lambda
AWS Lambda automatically executes your Go code,...Simply write your code and upload it to Lambda.

With *AWS Lambda*, you are however charged for every 100ms your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered. You pay only for the compute time you consume. Even though it is a paid service, I am covering it because it is not only one of the most popular platforms, it is the most cost-efficient too with absolutely no server downtimes and other issues.
