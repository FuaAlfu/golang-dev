## what is redis?
*Redis* stands for the Remote Dictionary Server.
It is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, and other lesser-used ones.
