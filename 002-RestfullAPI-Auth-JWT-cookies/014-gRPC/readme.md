## about gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance open-source feature-rich framework originally developed by Google and now is a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (or CNCF) just like Kubernetes or Prometheus.

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Calls, whereas the g doesnâ€™t stand for Google. Instead, it has changed between good, green, and glorious, game, gon, etc..
