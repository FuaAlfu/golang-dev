We will create arrestee API and go using Fiber package.
and we will define endpoints for the Restfull API.

## about Fiber
If you are coming from another language, such node-js and trying your hand at developing Go applications then Fiber is an incredibly easy framework to start working with.
It presents a familiar feel to Node.js developers who have previously built systems using Express.js. Itâ€™s also built on top of Fasthttp which is an incredibly performant and minimal HTTP engine built for Go.
