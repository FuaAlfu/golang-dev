## stacks and queues
the main diffrence between stacks and queues is, the way data is removed
*stack* have last in first out data structure:
LIFO
last in first out
when we put somthing in stack, an item or data , we call it push and when we take it out we call it pop
so push and pop would be the main two function that we use when we handle a stack.

for queues its gonna be 
FIFO witch stand for first in first out.
the first data or item to add to a queue won't be the first information to deal with.
add an item into a queue, we will say that, we enqueued an item
and when we take it out, we will say we dequeued it.
"took out the one that has been there for the longest time".
